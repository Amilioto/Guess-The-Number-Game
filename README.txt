~~~Description~~~

1. This is a simple number guessing game. A random number between 1 and 100 is created and stored as a hidden variable ("Hidden number"), another random number 
	from 1 to 100 is created and presented to the user ("Displayed number").

2. Using seven buttons three for increasing the value of the Displayed number, three for decreasing value, and one for checking the value, the user is tasked with 
	changing and checking the displayed number until it matches the Hidden number. Once the values match, the user wins and the game effectivley ends. 

3. Of the seven buttons, six are used for altering the value of the Displayed number. Two rows of buttons are used to increase or decrease the value of 
	the Displayed number by 1, 5, or 10 respectivley. An additional button for 'Check' allows the user to compare their guess (Displayed number) with the 
	Hidden number that was created at the start of the game, returning a correct or incorrect statment based on comparison. 

4. An additionmal two buttons located at the bottom of the main window are used for resetting and exiting the game. The 'Reset' button removes all attempts previously made
	and resets both the Hidden number and Displayed number to have newly generated numbers. 

5. There are no limits to how many times the user can change the Displayed number value nor is there a limit for how many checks the user can make, 
	although the amount of times the user checks their asnwer is tracked and kept as a 'Number of attempts' value. This 'Number of attempts' value is 
	presented at the end of the game in a second pop-up window along with additional buttons for restarting the game and exiting the game completley.
